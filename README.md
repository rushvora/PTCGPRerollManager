# Thobi's Pocket Reroll Manager - Discord Bot

![XlOCujH](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12eedef1-4237-4928-b175-288aea66d72f)

This repo is a Discord Bot written in javascript ES6 made to work with [Arturo PTCG Bot](https://github.com/Arturo-1212/PTCGPB) for the [PTCGP French Rerollers](https://discord.gg/pn6XSn42m6) community

# Features

## Automated IDs from Discord commands 
<img align="right" width="311" height="347" src="https://i.imgur.com/BamGht5.png">

Using **/SetPlayerID**, player are able to link their ID with their discord account

Once that's done, they can leave the pull by simply typing **/Add** or **/Remove** and it will **update a GitGist** that all players are linked with

As i'm using GitGist, the refresh time can be up to a maximum of 5 minutes

With **/SetAverageInstances**, players can also specify how many instances they are usually running and if the heartbeat is not received it will use this one waiting for the real number of instances

<br /> 

## Heartbeats implementation

You can ask your group to use heartbeat so everyone will know who's rerolling and who's not based on the webhook

It will auto update in a specific channel every 16 minutes (default value) and shows a lot of informations such as :
- Amount of Packs per minute for the session
- Total Amount of Packs
- Total Amount of Godpacks
- The GodPack average luck (which is a fun luck test)

Color means something for the username :
- ${\color{lightgreen}Green}$ : Heartbeat have been received in the last 30mn and the user is rerolling
- ${\color{yellow}Yellow}$ : Heartbeat have not been received in the last 30mn and active for < 30mn
- ${\color{red}Red}$ : Heartbeat have not been received in the last 30mn and active for > 30mn

You can also use **/addgpfound** and **/removegpfound** to fix false positive godpacks from arturo's bot
<br /> 
<br /> 

## Better GP management :

Instead of using only the webhook channel which is a nightmare to navigate, the bots generate automatically a thread in a forum channel with : 
- The Name and the Pack amount as title
- A **quote to all rerollers** that **were active** at the time of the GP pull
- The image and a link to the source (the webhook post)
In a forum post, peoples of your group can type **/Dead** or **/Verified** to change instantly the icon from ⌛ to 💀 or ✅

Moreover, you can type **/miss** and after a specific amount of miss based on packs ammount, it will automatically switch it as **/dead**. There's a thread on our discord if you have some ideas of funny sentences that the bot could say (As i also implemented a system that make the bot different things based on the % of miss)

<br /> 

## Usernames generator :

In order to know who's rerolling and who's not, the bot let you generate a list of usernames based on a suffix and keywords

Exemple : _/GenerateUsernames TOBI bae cute halp dang pwease noice UwU my that stoopid_

Will generate things like : "UwUstoopidTOBI", "pweasehalpTOBI", etc...

It helps tracking usernamers easily and brings joy to ppl in your group clearing their friendlist and seeing GP with funny names. With the arrival of the new Heartbeat system, it might become obsolete for presence check but it'll still be a small fun feature anyway
<br /> 
<br /> 

## Others :

If you wish to easily set up the bot for your server, i created a **Discord server template** based on our main server where we run the bot, here it is : https://discord.new/zXx8avYs85wk

The bot sentences can be switched from English to French only by changing a variable from ```true``` to ```false``` in config.json
<br /> 
<br /> 

# Install

- First, create your discord application (the bot), there's plenty of youtube videos explaining how to do [such as this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy5HGvrxM4o&t=134s)

Be sure to enable all Privileged Gateway Intents in the app settings

- Install Node.js 
- Ensure that your Windows Execution Policy is set to RemoteSigned or Unsigned
- Open VisualStudioCode > Terminal and run :
```
npm init -y
npm install discord.js
npm install octokit
npm install xml2js
npm install async-lock
npm update
```
- You're almost good to go, to make it start, run
```
node .
```
And press Ctrl+C to stop it. 

You can upload it on a server easily, I personnaly use discloud and it should work great once set up

Now place the repo in your project folder and edit config.json

- *token* is you Discord App token
- *guildID* is your Server ID
- For all *channelID_NameOfTheChannel* variable, you can link them wherever you want

Only for those ones you need to set them in different channels both linked with Arturo's webhooks
- *channelID_Webhook* is the channel ID were your group have their webhook linked to
- *channelID_Heartbeat* is the channel ID were your group have their hearbeat webhook linked to

**For the heartbeat to work**, you need to tell your group to input their **Discord ID in the left field** in Arturo's bot

After that [create a new fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for your GitHub account, and make sure to only check to read/write your Gists

Then, [create a GitGist](https://gist.github.com/) and get it's ID (the numbers in the URL). Now you're ready to fill out the last two variables in config.js and **modify the GitGistName variable in index.mjs** with you git file name

In Arturo's bot the url should be placed in Friend ID and look like this : "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/{YourUsername}/{YourGitGistID}/raw"
<br /> 
<br /> 

# Known Issues :

- If you have the error telling you **"Cannot find module"**, you might have dropped the repo in your project too fast, go to file Package.jon and replace ```index.js,``` with ```index.mjs,``` and add ```type:module,``` right after if you're missing it too.
<br /> 

# TODO :

- Support heartbeat for users with multiple PCs farming for the same account ( at this time for users with multiple pcs they should only enable heartbeat on the better one )

- Use the new 2 star filter webhook to create forum post in another or the same forum channel as for gp

- Filter out all the potentiel banwords from the user generated list and remove then, at this time it only filters special characters

- Look for a way to let the possibility to create dynamically updating multiple subgroups to better optimize the number of packs per minute

- Any idea of yours ? feel free to [join the discord](https://discord.gg/pn6XSn42m6) and create a new forum post in "Bot-Suggestions"
